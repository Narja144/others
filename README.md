My first codes

Hi Humans,

My name is Matthew Seitl. I'm 28 years old and I am from Czech Republic (currently Czechia).

My first bits of code are in this repository.

! File "Anund.per" is part of AI complex which was created by "zergs from aok.heavengames.com" as "The Horde AI".
I made only few changes mainly focused on adapting these AI on my modified version of game "Age of Conquerors 1.0e" .
